# Question

`app.get(endpoint, controller)` takes in a `controller` as the second argument.

What is a controller?

# Answer
Yes, you're right, with a slight expansion for clarity: <---- uhhh

A controller, in the context of web development and frameworks such as Express.js for Node.js applications, is a function designed to process requests. The request from an endpoint is processed based on the controller function.
